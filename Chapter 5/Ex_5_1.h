/*
 * You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
 * Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e.g., M becomes
 * a substring of N located at i and starting at j).
 * EXAMPLE:
 * Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10101, i=2,j=6
 * Output:N = 10001010100
