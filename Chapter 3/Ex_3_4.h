/*
 * In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 rods and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower.
 * The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (e.g., each disk sits on top of an even larger one).
 * You have the following constraints:
 * (A) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * (B) A disk is slid off the top of one rod onto the next rod.
 * (C) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
 *  Write a program to move the disks from the first rod to the last using Stacks.
